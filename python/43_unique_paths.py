Question:
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m×n grid (marked ‘Start’ in
the diagram below). The robot can only move either down or right at any
point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner
of the grid (marked ‘Finish’ in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?
